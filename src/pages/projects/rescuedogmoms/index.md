My partner Yamini and I have been fostering dogs since the start of the pandemic. We had what's known as a foster fail with our first dog, Boss, who still remains a valued (and spoiled) member of our household. Yamini has her fingers deep in a number of dog-rescue pies and records entertaining and enlightening conversational content with her 'dog-friends'. <a href="https://www.rescuedogmoms.ca/" target="_blank">Check out her episodes here</a>.
