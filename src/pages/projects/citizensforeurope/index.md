Citizens for Europe is a platform for European-based citizens and civil society organisations to share ideas and engage one another in helping shape democracy in an increasingly estranged Europe. Made up of just under 300 NGOs, the platform needed a new visual identity and website that allowed it to not only increase its social outreach, but also actively promote communication between its existing members. When they approached me asking for help, I was regularly collaborating with [FBA.](http://www.fba.pt/), so I worked together with them in bringing the brand and Website to life.

The idea for the logo popped up soon after I saw the first sentence in the briefing documents we were handed. It read: "Citizens for Europe is an organisation run for and by citizens, working together towards a more participative and democratic Europe". I highlighted the words citizens, together and Europe, and went looking for things that could broadly convey those concepts. Europe was quite obvious: one of the stars in the European flag. It was actually almost too obvious, and we debated whether we should resort to that kind of clich√© or try to find something a bit more nuanced. In the end, though, we stuck to it, because it pieced together nicely with the other elements: fingerprints woven together, representing both citizenship and unity.

I'll admit it sounds a bit far-stretched, when you try to explain the concept. And the first few sketches I came up didn't help either, as they looked either forced or boring. But right as I was about to give up, things seemed to fall into place. I had a logo I was actually quite happy with, and that I felt managed to combine all three concepts into a single image.

The original proposal also had an interesting idea that we ended up having to drop. At the time, I was thinking of ways we could engage people into interacting with the brand, and I figured there was a clear opportunity to do it right in the name. You simply switch the words Citizens and Europe for anything else you want, and you can use the logo as a vessel for any personal or political message you want to broadcast. To allow for the brand not to get lost in the process, the word "for" was styled differently in the original logo, so that even when you take away the star and replace two thirds of the words in the logo, the brand is still there.
